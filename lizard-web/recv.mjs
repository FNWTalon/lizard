// Receiver page: camera frames to a pool of decode workers. A frame that arrives while every worker
// is busy is skipped, not queued: a stale frame is worth less than the next one.
//
// The pool starts at one worker and grows only while frames are being lost to busy workers, up to
// navigator.hardwareConcurrency: a phone that keeps up with one worker runs one, and stays cooler.
// What is shared between workers lives here: the set of block ids already seen (two workers often
// decode two captures of the same display frame) and, through one fountain worker, the file.
// ai: The decoder (Settings: GPU or CPU, auto while neither is chosen; ?dec=) swaps the pool for one GPU worker (recv-gpu-worker.mjs, the whole decode on WebGPU,
// ai: gpu/). It is sent every frame and batches them; its results take the same path as the pool's.
// ai: The whole receiver is blind (2026-09-26): both decoders are told nothing, each frame is read at the picture
// ai: size and version its own word names, its blocks judged from the light (a test frame is known by its blocks'
// ai: bytes), nothing carries between frames beyond a batch, and a file comes from the light's header. Nothing is fetched
// ai: from a server: stats rows and received files are posted as development logs (devlog.mjs), best effort,
// ai: never awaited.
// One canvas, #shot, is both what is on screen and what is read back for the decoder. It used to be two answers:
// the screen got the <video> under CSS object-fit: cover, resolved by the compositor, and the decoder got a
// drawImage source rect, resolved by the canvas. On Firefox for Android above 720p they disagreed, so the square
// aimed with was not the square decoded (another project's scanner had the same bug on another engine). Which of the
// two was wrong cannot be told from JS and does not matter: a crop the preview cannot show cannot exist when the
// preview is the crop.
// ai: Neither is needed where the camera's frame goes over as a VideoFrame (vframes.mjs): to the GPU worker under F0,
// ai: or to a pool worker, which copies the crop to luma itself (recv-worker.mjs lumaOf). Then the camera element is the
// ai: preview and the canvas is drawn only wherever no VideoFrame goes (preview). Under the GPU decoder on Chrome the
// ai: worker reads the camera track itself (sendTrack): this page's callback then only counts frames.
