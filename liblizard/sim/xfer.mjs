// The transfer in the light for the rig (src/xfer.h holds the layouts and their reasons): the sender's schedule, and a
// receiver that puts a file back together from blocks alone, each chunk checked against the file's BLAKE3 root.
//
// Pure JS. The codec's wasm (sim/ob.mjs init(), for BLAKE3 and the header), Wirehair (sim/fountain.mjs) and zstd
// (sim/zstd.mjs, as Z) are handed in, so sim/phy.mjs and the receiver page take the id test from here without loading
// any of them.
//
// COMPRESSION (2026-10-05, src/xfer.h): every chunk is compressed on its own, one zstd frame where that is shorter than
// its bytes, else sent as it is; its fountain carries the sent bytes. The manifest names each chunk's sent bytes and
// seed attempt (one chunk: the header), so a receiver solves no chunk before the manifest is in; the control cycle puts
// it within an eighth of a lap. The file's length, root and chaining values are the file's own bytes.
//
// THE SCHEDULE: every chunk interleaved with every other, in proportion to its blocks, over the whole file (a lap),
// and laps repeated for as long as the sender runs, each with fresh repair ids. Not chunks in turn, because a camera's
// loss is steady and bursty, not rare: LIZARD degrades instead of stopping, so at a distance the outer rings go and a
// frame brings a share of its blocks, and a hand that moves loses whole seconds. In turn, a chunk gets a fixed budget
// a lap (K plus a margin m, since nothing comes back to say it arrived); a receiver losing more than m / (1 + m) of
// its blocks finishes no chunk in the first lap, and the margin itself is airtime a receiver that loses nothing throws
// away. Interleaved, a file takes 1 / (1 - loss) laps at any loss. Counted over 64 MB at 4 MiB, LIZARD-512, laps of
// airtime from the join to the last chunk (1.000 the least possible; STATUS.md has the table):
//                         interleaved   in turn m=0.1   m=0.25   m=0.5   ideal
//   nothing lost             1.001          1.099        1.246    1.492   1.000
//   joined 50% into a lap    1.001          1.094        1.225    1.459   1.000
//   15% lost at random       1.184          2.183        1.249    1.495   1.176
//   outer 25% of rings       1.347          2.186        2.480    1.497   1.333
//   2 s lost every 10 s      1.271          2.126        3.743    2.977   1.250
// A late join costs neither schedule anything: in turn the chunk being sent when the camera arrived comes round again
// at the end of its lap, which is when the file would end anyway.
// What it costs: no chunk completes before the end of the first lap, so the receiver holds every chunk's blocks at
// once. It keeps them on disk (the origin private file system, OPFS) where the browser has one, so its memory is a
// chunk or two at a solve, not the file. The sender holds every chunk's Wirehair encoder, about 1.75 times the file,
// which is what the one-fountain file mode held too.
//
// Blocks are spread over a frame's slots by a shuffle drawn from the frame count: slot k of a LIZARD frame is ring k,
// the outer ones the first to go, and a plain round robin would pin chunk c to the same slots whenever the chunk count
// divides the frame's (every chunk on a ring that a distant camera never reads). Control blocks (the header, then the
// manifest) are shuffled with the data, so no one slot carries them: until 2026-10-10 they took slot 0, the lowest
// ring, thought the one read first and lost last, which under the rate profile carries the 7/8 code on the
// innermost sub-channel and for some contents never decodes, the header's among them.

// src/xfer.h, held against the codec's xfer_layout whenever a wasm is handed in. The receiver page has no codec and
// needs the id test anyway.
